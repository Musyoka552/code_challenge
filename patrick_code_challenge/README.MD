### Challenge1
ABOUT THE GRADOR The program defines a function 'calculateGrade'that calculates the grade based on the input marks and specified grade ranges. The 'main' function takes the input marks using 'prompt', calls 'calculateGrade', and displays the corresponding grade using 'console.log'.

Grade Ranges
   - The program checks the value of `marks` 
     - If `marks` is greater than 79, prints "Grade: A".
     - If between 60 and 79  prints "Grade: B".
     - If between 50 and 59 , prints "Grade: C".
     - If between 40 and 49 , prints "Grade: D".
     - If less than 40, prints "Grade: E".


   ### Challenge2

**Speed Detector** 
- This JavaScript program takes the speed of a car as input and calculates demerit points based on the specified criteria.
- It then prints the appropriate message according to the number of demerit points. 
 GUIDES The program defines a function calculateDemeritPoints that calculates demerit points based on the input speed and a predefined speed limit.
 - The main function takes the input speed, calls calculateDemeritPoints, and logs the appropriate message based on the demerit points. Example : If the speed is less than 70 km/h, it prints: "Ok". If the speed is greater than or equal to 70 km/h, it calculates and prints the demerit points. If the demerit points exceed 12, it prints: "License suspended".
 
### Challenge3

### Input
   - Reads the user inputs for basic salary and benefits.
### Calculations
   - Gross Salary: Sum of basic salary and benefits.
   - NSSF Deduction: Calculated as `grossSalary * NSSF_RATE`.
   - Taxable Income: Gross salary minus NHIF and NSSF deductions.
   - Net Salary: Gross salary minus tax, NHIF, and NSSF deductions.
   ### Outputs
   - The program prints detailed salary components including basic salary, benefits, gross salary, deductions (NHIF, NSSF), tax (PAYE), and net salary.
